# Onboarding Guide

This onboarding guide is meant to serve as the first stop for new students and 
postdocs joining the group.

## Computing devices

- Purchase computing devices for your research, including a Macbook Pro (the 14" model
  is a great choice) a monitor (e.g., `DELL P2723QE`), a SSD Drive (
  e.g., `WD 4TB My Passport for Mac`) and other accessories. Email Mingjian a list of
  your choices with product weblinks for approval. Once approved, contact Manjunatha Shenoy (
  director of engineering computing) to make a quote and Nicolette Solano (department
  administrative assistant) to make orders.
- Configure your Mac for computational research, following [Setting up Your Laptop](label:laptop).
- Set up conda to manage Python packages, following [Setting up Conda Environment](label:conda).

## Coding
  - We use Unix-like operating systems and the command line interface (CLI) for most of our work. Get comfortable with the CLI by doing the 
    Software Carpentry [Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) 
    tutorials and referring to the [Command Line Tools](label:cli) page.
  - We mostly program in Python and use other languages (e.g., C++ and Rust) 
    when necessary. Get yourself familiar with Python by waking through the 
    [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) tutorials.


## Meetings
- Schedule with Mingjian a first meeting to discuss and plan your research projects.
  After the meeting, send Mingjian a headshot as well as a short paragraph introducing you and your research to be put on the group website.
- Schedule with Mingjian regular meetings to discuss your research progress and 
  get feedback.

## Communication
  - We use Slack for swift research discussion, seeking help, sharing awesome papers 
    and such. Ask an existing group member to invite you to the group Slack workspace.
