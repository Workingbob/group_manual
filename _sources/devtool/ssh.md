## Generating an SSH keys 


```{warning}
This will generate a new SSH key pair `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` in the `~/.ssh` directory.
It will overwrite existing ones. So, if you already have an SSH key pair, you should back up 
them before generating a new one.
```

- Open your terminal and enter the following command. Change the `your_email@gmail.com`
  to your own email address or other comments.
```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@gmail.com"
```
- This will start the process of generating your SSH key and you will be directed to enter a file name for the key.   
- Press **Enter** to accept the default file names (`id_rsa` for the private key and 
  `id_rsa.pub` for the public key) and the default location (`~/.ssh` directory).  
- Enter a passphrase for the key. This is optional but highly recommended for added 
  security.(Pressing **Enter** to leave it blank will not use any passphrase.)

Don't share with others your private key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and passphrase.

You can view the public key by:
```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
