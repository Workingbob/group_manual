# Text Editor

We recommend [vim](https://www.vim.org) as your primary text editor.
Vim is pre-installed on Mac and most Linux systems, it is built to make creating and
changing any kind of text very efficient. In addition, vim is highly configurable via the [.vimrc](https://vimconfig.com) file.


## Tutorial

You can start the official vim tutorial from your terminal by typing `vimtutor`.

```bash
$ vimtutor
```

Alternatively, follow the [tutorial](https://www.openvim.com) on the OpenVim website 
and at other places (e.g., https://opensource.com/article/19/3/getting-started-vim).

## MacVim

MacVim is a standalone GUI version of vim. It becomes handy when you want to quickly 
edit some text without opening a terminal. You can install it from [here](https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/).

## vim in IDEs

Most IDEs do offer a vim mode. You can set it up in PyCharm, VSCode, and even in Obsidian.
